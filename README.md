## Documentation
The parsePDF script enables users to parse pdf's and calculate the most occuring noun chunks by making use of the spacy and textract library. 

Option 1: run the python script and add the directory in which the pdf files are stored as a argument. 

Option 2: run the python script in the directory where the pdf files are stored, in this case there is no need in passing on a argument while executing. 

Output: the script will create a folder in which the frequency of noun chunks for each article are stored in seperate text files that carry the same name as the articles.
